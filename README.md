# TFAC
A tool for analysis of team-fortress-2 cheats.

This is not to be mistaken with an anticheat despite it's misleading name. I pretty much wrote this tool in a rush, for forensic analysis for video game cheats.

During the time of this being used, several paid cheat providers have raised at least one detection within TFAC. 
You can utilize it to inspect their hook handlers, and potentially other, core cheat logic like features.
