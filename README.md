# TFAC
A tool for analysis of team-fortress-2 cheats.

This is not to be mistaken with an anticheat despite it's misleading name. I pretty much wrote this tool in a rush, for forensic analysis of video game cheats.

During the time of this being used, several paid cheat providers have raised at least one detection within TFAC. 
You can utilize it to inspect their hook handlers, and potentially other, core cheat logic like features.

# Features
- automated enumeration of game interfaces.
- performing integrity checks on game interfaces.
- a bad and rushed .text patch detection.

The VMT detection is very reliable, .text patch detection not so much. 
I will release a more complete project that is universal and has less rushed shit soon.
